However, BERTopic does not have a function to extract the X and Y coords from UMAP. If we need the coordinates then use the notebooks `Topic_Models_using_Transformers` instead. In any other situation, when a quick analysis is needed this notebook may be better.\n",

       "['Phenology-Based Rice Paddy Mapping Using Multi-Source Satellite Imagery and a Fusion Algorithm Applied to the Poyang Lake Plain, Southern China Accurate information about the spatiotemporal patterns of rice paddies is essential for the assessment of food security, management of agricultural resources, and sustainability of ecosystems. However, accurate spatial datasets of rice paddy fields and multi-cropping at fine resolution are still lacking. Landsat observation is the primary source of remote sensing data that has continuously mapped regional rice paddy fields at a 30-m spatial resolution since the 1980s. However, Landsat data used for rice paddy studies reveals some challenges, especially data quality issues (e.g., cloud cover). Here, we present an algorithm that integrates time-series Landsat and MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) images with a phenology-based approach (ILMP) to map rice paddy planting fields and multi-cropping patterns. First, a fusion of MODIS and Landsat data was used to reduce the cloud contamination, which added more information to the Landsat time series data. Second, the unique biophysical features of rice paddies during the flooding and open-canopy periods (which can be captured by the dynamics of the vegetation indices) were used to identify rice paddy regions as well as those of multi-cropping. This algorithm was tested for 2015 in Nanchang County, which is located on the Poyang Lake plain in southern China. We evaluated the resultant map of the rice paddy and multi-cropping systems using ground-truth data and Google Earth images. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the rice paddy planting areas were 93.66% and 0.85, respectively. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the multi-cropping regions were 92.95% and 0.89, respectively. In addition, our algorithm was more capable of capturing detailed information about areas with fragmented cropland than that of the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) from 2015. These results demonstrated the great potential of our algorithm for mapping rice paddy fields and using the multi-cropping index in complex landscapes in southern China.',\n",
       " 'Mapping a Paddy Rice Area in a Cloudy and Rainy Region Using Spatiotemporal Data Fusion and a Phenology-Based Algorithm The timely and accurate mapping of paddy rice is important to ensure food security and to protect the environment for sustainable development. Existing paddy rice mapping methods are often remote sensing technologies based on optical images. However, the availability of high-quality remotely sensed paddy rice growing area data is limited due to frequent cloud cover and rain over the southwest China. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose a paddy rice field mapping method by combining a spatiotemporal fusion algorithm and a phenology-based algorithm. First, a modified neighborhood similar pixel interpolator (MNSPI) time series approach was used to remove clouds on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 OLI images in 2020. A flexible spatiotemporal data fusion (FSDAF) model was used to fuse Sentinel-2 data and MODIS data to obtain multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images. Then, the fused remote sensing data were used to construct fusion time series data to produce time series vegetation indices (NDVI\\\\LSWI) having a high spatiotemporal resolution (10 m and & LE;16 days). On this basis, the unique physical characteristics of paddy rice during the transplanting period and other auxiliary data were combined to map paddy rice in Yongchuan District, Chongqing, China. Our results were validated by field survey data and showed a high accuracy of the proposed method indicated by an overall accuracy of 93% and the Kappa coefficient of 0.85. The paddy rice planting area map was also consistent with the official data of the third national land survey; at the town level, the correlation between official survey data and paddy rice area was 92.5%. The results show that this method can effectively map paddy rice fields in a cloudy and rainy area.',\n",
       " 'Mapping Paddy Rice Planting Area in Northeastern China Using Spatiotemporal Data Fusion and Phenology-Based Method Accurate paddy rice mapping with fine spatial detail is significant for ensuring food security and maintaining sustainable environmental development. In northeastern China, rice is planted in fragmented and patchy fields and its production has reached over 10% of the total amount of rice production in China, which has brought the increasing need for updated paddy rice maps in the region. Existing methods for mapping paddy rice are often based on remote sensing techniques by using optical images. However, it is difficult to obtain high quality time series remote sensing data due to the frequent cloud cover in rice planting area and low temporal sampling frequency of satellite imagery. Therefore, paddy rice maps are often developed using few Landsat or time series MODIS images, which has limited the accuracy of paddy rice mapping. To overcome these limitations, we presented a new strategy by integrating a spatiotemporal fusion algorithm and phenology-based algorithm to map paddy rice fields. First, we applied the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) to fuse the Landsat and MODIS data and obtain multi-temporal Landsat-like images. From the fused Landsat-like images and the original Landsat images, we derived time series vegetation indices (VIs) with high temporal and high spatial resolution. Then, the phenology-based algorithm, considering the unique physical features of paddy rice during the flooding and transplanting phases/open-canopy period, was used to map paddy rice fields. In order to prove the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, we compared our results with those from other three classification strategies: (1) phenology-based classification based on original Landsat images only, (2) phenology-based classification based on original MODIS images only and (3) random forest (RF) classification based on both Landsat and Landsat-like images. The validation experiments indicate that our fusion-and phenology-based strategy could improve the overall accuracy of classification by 6.07% (from 92.12% to 98.19%) compared to using Landsat data only, and 8.96% (from 89.23% to 98.19%) compared to using MODIS data, and 4.66% (from93.53% to 98.19%) compared to using the RF algorithm. The results show that our new strategy, by integrating the spatiotemporal fusion algorithm and phenology-based algorithm, can provide an effective and robust approach to map paddy rice fields in regions with limited available images, as well as the areas with patchy and fragmented fields.']"
